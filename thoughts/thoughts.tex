% The goal of the savetrees package is to pack as much text as
% possible onto each page of a LATEX document. Admittedly, this makes
% the document far less attractive. Nevertheless, savetrees is a
% simple way to SAVE PAPER WHEN PRINTING DRAFT COPIES of a
% document. It can also be useful when trying to meet a tight
% page-length requirement for a conference or journal submission.

\begin{document}

Do $n$-grams observe Ziff's law when looking at the subset of the
$n$-grams of the same size:

Let $W_i = \{w_1,w_2\ldots,w_m\} \cup \{w_2,w_1,\ldots,w_m\} \cup
\ldots\}$ be the set of n-grams for word $W_I$. Let $\omega_i =
\{w_k,\ldots,w_m\}_i$ be the $W_{ij}$ where $j$ denotes the merge
operation above.

Since we are preserving the order of the n-grams, we can measure the
ratio, $\|W_1\| < \|W_2\| <\ldots < \|W_m\|$.  Does this ratio assume
the same properties as if Ziff's law.  That is, since Ziff's law
states that the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as
often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the
third most frequent word, etc.. Can the same be said of all $n$-grams.

Most formally: Will the most frequent item, $W_1$, occur twice as
often as the second most frequent $n$-gram, $W_2$ when they are
$n$-grams of the same size and the constituent words are identical.
