== YAPS: Yet Another Parser for Subtitles ==

The purpose of these tools is to help extract some meaningful data
from the volumes of subtitle files available on the web.

For a complete index of where a word exists in a film, simply run the
following command line:

    ./yaps sample.srt

Where ''sample.srt'' is a subtitle file.  The output will resemble the
following:

    been, 00:00:56.656
    failures, 00:00:56.656
    have, 00:00:56.656
    operations, 00:00:56.656
    recent, 00:00:56.656
    ...

And so on.  One day this might actually be useful.
